sails-swagr
=========

Originally forked from [swagger-express](https://github.com/fliptoo/swagger-express), however, heavily 
customized to meet Swagger 2.0 specifications and to work solely with [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/).

__sails-swagr__ is a simple and clean solution to integrate swagger with Sails.

### Summary

This module will do it best to autogenerate everything it can from Sails configuration and create
a Swagger 2.0 JSON Specification to be used with the Swagger-UI. After routes and models have been generated, 
you may create a `docs` directory under `api/` and place YML documents with paths definitions for each Controller. As a result, the generated JSONs and YAMLs will be **merged**. 

## Installation

    $ npm install sails-swagr --save

## Quick Start

Configure sails-swagr as express middleware.


`apiVersion`      -> Your api version.

`swaggerVersion`  -> Swagger version.

`swaggerURL`      -> Path to use for swagger ui web interface.

`swaggerJSON`     -> Path to use for swagger ui JSON.

`basePath`        -> The basePath for swagger.js

`info`            -> [Metadata][info] about the API

`apis`            -> Define your api array.

`middleware`      -> Function before response.

## Sails Integration

Create a file called express.js in your config folder and put the code:

```javascript
  var path = require('path');

  /**
   * Express Custom Middleware
   * (sails.config.middleware.cutom)
   *
   * Configure custom express middleware which will be exposed
   * automatically by Sails.
   *
   * For more information on configuration, check out:
   * https://gist.github.com/mikermcneil/6255295
   */

  module.exports.express = {
    middleware: {
      custom: true
    },

    customMiddleware: function (app) {
      var swagger = require('sails-swagr');
      var express = require('../node_modules/sails/node_modules/express');

      app.use(
        swagger.init(express, app, {
          apiVersion: '1.0',
          swaggerVersion: '2.0',
          swaggerURL: '/api/docs',
          swaggerJSON: '/api-docs.json',
          basePath: "http://localhost:1337",
          info: {
            title: ' API Doc ',
            description: 'API Services Documentation'
          },
          apis: [
            './api/docs/User.yml',
          ]
        })
      );
      app.use(app.router);
      sails.on('ready', function () {
        // Exclude some route from ApiDoc
        var exclude = [
          'csrfToken', 
          'csrftoken', 
          '__getcookie', 
          '^[\w\W]*\/(v1)\/[\w\W]*',
          'v1',
          'swagger'];
        
        swagger.sailsGenerate({
          exclude: exclude,
          routes: sails.router._privateRouter.routes,
          models: sails.models
        });
      });
    }
  };

```

#### Swagger-UI

Lift sails and navigate to the specified `swaggerURL` e.g. 

```
http://localhost:1337/api/docs
```


## Read from YAML file

Example 'Users.yml'

```yml

paths:
  /login:
    post:
      summary: Login with username and password
      notes: Returns a user based on username
      responseClass: User
      nickname: login
      consumes: 
        - text/html
      parameters:

      - name: username
        dataType: string
        paramType: query
        required: true
        description: Your username

      - name: password
        dataType: string
        paramType: query
        required: true
        description: Your password

definitions:
  User:
    properties:
      username:
        type: String
      password:
        type: String    
```
